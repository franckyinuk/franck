The smallest imaginable haptic screen would need to be 45x30, any lower and then we cannot see a thing.
But that's already 1350 vibration motors and that will be nearly impossible to control with arduinos like stuff
An ideal size seems to be 150x100, thus 15000 motors, and that would be even less doable, as the smallest motors are about 1gr, so at least 15 kg for the vest

The next step would be to look at screen technology since they already manage crazy resolutions like 1048x1900 and see if it can be reused for motors
